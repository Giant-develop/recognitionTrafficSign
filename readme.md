# Recognize Traffic Signal



#### Do you want to start a machine to recognize traffic signal?

1.  I have prepared 43 folders that represent different classes for machine learning.
2. Now you will repeat all of these classes with the help of the OS module and add images and tags to the datums and tags.
3. Converts this list to Numpy.
4. Split learning datums using the train_test_split() method of SkLearn package.
5. Use the to_categorical() method of the Keras package to convert the lavbel to  one-hot encoding.
6. Constructs a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model that best suits image classification to categorize images to its category.
7. After building the model architecture, use model.fit() to learn the model.
8. Laying Matplotlib to float the graph's for accuracy and loss.
9. Gets the accuracy score in SkLearn.Metrics.
10. Finally, you save the model learned using the model.save() funciton of the Keras.





##### ***Wow! Fantastic and comfortable! Jupyter notebook is good!***
